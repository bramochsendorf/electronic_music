# The evolution of house, techno, and electro music.

When I moved to Amsterdam (~2005) I discovered electronic music. Particularly popular in the Amsterdam club scene during that time was Electro/Electro House (because of the likes of Boys Noize, Tiefschwarz, Digitalism, Justice, MSTRKRFT etc.), which was followed up by waves of Minimal, Tech House, Dub Step, Deep House, you name it. 

Looking back, it strikes me how fast these particular music genres went in and out of fashion, as there are major differences between e.g. Electro and Deephouse (although this may not appear so obvious to the untrained ear). To see what may drive particular mood-swings in the electronic music scene I explored how different genres of electronic music have evolved over time. Which music characteristics determine how popular (or 'mainstream') a given genre is (and will be)? 

For this project, I queried the Spotify API to obtain tracks of a given music genre during the 1980-2016 timespan. For every track, I use the:

(1) Popularity --> parameterized from 0 (least popular) to 1 (most popular). Based on Spotify's magic algorithm (read: black box) on total playcount and how recent these are 

(2) Tempo --> in Beats Per Minute (BPM).

(3) Loudness --> in dB.

(4) Danceability --> parameterized from 0 to 1 through one of Spotify's magic algorithms.

(5) Instrumentalness --> parameterized from 0 to 1 through one of Spotify's magic algorithms. Gives a measure on the amoun vocal in a song (a song without any vocals would have Instrumentalness = 1).

(6) Valence --> parameterized from 0 to 1 through one of Spotify's magic algorithms. Gives a measure of 'positive' (value 1) or 'negative' energy (value 0) embedded in a song.

These parameters give us some insight into how different music genres have evolved over time, and may predict which genres will be hottest in the coming years.

Main conclusions:

onclusions:

- techno and house are getting more popular, whereas electro is more constant, with perhaps a small lingering fetish for mid-to-late 80's electro music. 

- house and electro are becoming louder, which does not help their danceability.

- techno remains very instrumental, electro very 'vocal'.

- all three music genres have decreasing valences, most notably Techno.


In short, it appears that mainstream electronic music becomes louder, not particular danceable, which may be in line with the popularity of ear-splitting tunes from, e.g., Skrillex.  


be smart for record labels or aspiring DJs/producers to dive into the house/techno business, as long as you tracks are loud, not particular danceable, and full of negative energy. Be sure to warn your neighbors beforehand, though.
